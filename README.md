## project automation web for technical test radya labs
this project is built with selenium 4 java using maven repository help

*note: because the website **doesn't have a class, id, or name,** so I used **XPath** to found elements. <br>
if there is an error like this while you're running this project, it is because the element you are referring to was removed from the DOM structure due to adding, changing, or deleting data.

```
stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document
```
or
```
no such element
```

you have to copy the xpath element manually by inspect element
